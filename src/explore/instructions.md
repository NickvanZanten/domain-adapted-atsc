This tool allows teams to parse and analyze texts such as reviews, verbatims, tweets, etc. using the pipeline contained within this tool.

This tool is most useful if you have more than 10k reviews, verbatims, tweets, etc. Especially if you have a need for recurring analysis of the same data. For example, annual surveys with the same categories, constant influx of similar textual data, or one time large volumes of data.
